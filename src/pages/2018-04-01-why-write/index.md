# Why write?


Without too much fanfare or ceremony, I’d like to say 'Hello, world!' with my first-ever blog post.

 ```Hello, world```
 
 Ok, there, I said it.

Here’s a little background on me: My name is John. I’m a 32-year old guy who is married with 4 (yes, 4!) kids.

 

I got into programming last year as an interest, and over the course of five months was able to progress enough to make a career transition into a front-end developer role.

 

Yes that seems pretty quick – it still feels a bit surreal that I am now a developer by trade. Along the way I’ve made some good choices and a whole load of mistakes…

 

BUT- I have always pushed to work on my development skills every day.

 

During my time of learning (before taking my first dev job), I kept a journal on github of my daily progress. It’s nothing fancy- you can check it out [here](www.github.com/johndpotts/learning-programming-journal).

 

Now that I’ve had a few months to settle into the rhythm of doing development full-time, I wanted to set out another challenge to keep myself learning and growing. I’ve read a number of times that if you want to understand a concept really well, write a blog post on it. So I’ve set out a goal to take the next 50 days and write one post each day on things I’m learning. I don’t have any aspirations of becoming a famous blogger- this is really more for my own understanding (but I’m glad to be an answer to someone’s google search along the way!)

 

I plan to hit pretty heavily on beginning/intermediate development topics, with a smattering of soft skills and leadership posts just for good measure.

 

Thanks for checking this out, and wherever you are in your development journey, keep moving!
