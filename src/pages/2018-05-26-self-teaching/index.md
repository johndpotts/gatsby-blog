Last year, in the course of 5 months, I went from someone who had never written a line of code in my life to a new career as a full-time Front End developer. I did it without attending a college or boot camp. I had a few great folks who fielded questions for me and offered excellent advice, but no actual mentor.

Now I don't have anything against boot camps per say; in fact I briefly considered attending one, but as parent in a one income family just couldn't justify the cost and the need to miss work for months to attend an in-person boot camp.

I had done enough searching to see that all of the information you'll learn in a boot camp is available for free online. The things you're paying for in a boot camp are these:

1.  An environment that encourages you to focus on learning
2.  A community to learn along with
3.  A clear roadmap of what you should be learning
4.  Mentorship by instructors
5.  A network (and hopefully job leads) in the local area

My thought process was simply this- would I, and could I, replicate those things? If so, would it be worth what I would pay to go to a boot camp? For me, the answer was yes.

The decision I made isn't for everyone. I think well-run development boot camps have a great deal to offer, especially if you learn best in a classroom-type setting. But for me, it wasn't the best fit, and I'm glad to have gone through the effort of learning on my own.

In a future post I'll explore the strategy I pursued over 5 months of self-teaching that brought me to my first development role.
