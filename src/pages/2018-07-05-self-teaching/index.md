# Teaching yourself to Code (why I didn't go to a bootcamp)

Last year, in the course of 5 months, I went from someone who had never written a line of code in my life to a new career as a full-time Front End developer. I did it without attending a college or bootcamp. I had a few great folks who fielded questions for me and offered excellent advice, but no actual mentor.

Now I don't have anything against bootcamps per say; in fact I briefly considered attending one, but as parent in a one income family just couldn't justify the cost and the need to miss work for months to attend an in-person bootcamp.

I had done enough searching to see that all of the information you'll learn in a bootcamp is available for free online. The things you're paying for in a bootcamp are these:

1. An environment that encourages you to focus on learning
2. A community to learn along with
3. A clear roadmap of what you should be learning
4. Mentorship by instructors
5. A network (and hopefully job leads) in the local area
