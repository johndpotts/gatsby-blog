Ten reasons Debugging Stole Your Day (and how to keep it from happening again)


##### The Problem:
You’re not sure what could cause this to happen and have no clue how to fix it
##### The Solution:
Take a methodical approach – what happened? What order? How did it change state/data?

##### The Problem:
You were fighting with thousands of lines of CSS and a bunch of spaghetti javascript written by someone else.
##### The Solution:
Isolate the problem

##### The Problem:
Just trying to see what’s going on is taking forever.
##### The Solution:
Learn your tools

##### The Problem:
You’re not sure if this is a framework problem, a logical problem, or just a cruel practical joke.
##### The Solution:
If you’re new to dev, FOCUS on the FUNDAMENTALS. Oftentimes, what you think is an issue with your particular framework is really just a mistake or nuance in the language itself. Some of the best advice I was given when I was first starting out in front end dev was to learn vanilla javascript before getting too far into Vue, Angular, React, etc.

##### The Problem:
Google searching the console error didn’t immediately fix your problem
##### The Solution:
Up your google-fu. Learn to be more specific with your google searches- use an accurate description of the problem and search modifiers.

##### The Problem:
What you’re dealing with is nowhere in the documentation
##### The Solution:
Get comfortable going beyond documentation into source code. Some of the biggest 'aha!' moments I had early on in development were when I realized I could just look into the cource code of an application and discover things that were completely left out of the documentation. Documentation is great, but you can't always trust it to be comprehensive.

##### The Problem:
You spent hours on a problem and feel like you’re going in circles
##### The Solution:
Rubber duck or replicate. Sometimes talking your way through a problem- either to another person or a synthetic waterfowl- is the best way to trigger a solution in your mind. I can't tell you how many times I've solved a problem halfway through explaining it to someone else!

##### The Problem:
You beat your head against the wall for 3 hours instead of having a 30-second conversation.
##### The Solution:
Know when to take a break. This goes right in line with rubber ducking; sometimes you just need a change in scenery and a little bit of mental space. I'll often step outside and take a quick walk around our office building if I'm struggling with a tough problem. I've even had answers to coding problems come to me in my sleep!

##### The Problem:
You have a hard time understanding all the moving parts
##### The Solution:
Ask for help

##### The Problem:
I followed all of the above steps and still ran into a crazy edge case that took me all day to get through
##### The Solution:
Go home, have a beer, and live to fight another day.
